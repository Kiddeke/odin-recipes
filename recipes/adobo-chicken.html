    <h2>Yummy Chicken Adobo - A Staple Filipino Dish</h2>
    <p>
      Adobo's name is derived from the Spanish term adobar and adobado, meaning
      "in sauce", or "in marinade". Although the name comes from the Spanish,
      the recipe is inherently indigenous to the Phillipines.

      <li>1/4 large red onion</li>
      <li>1/2 head garlic</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 medium scallion</li>
      <li>2 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms</li>
      <li>
        3 pounds chicken drumsticks and/or bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola or coconut oil</li>
      <li>
        3/4 cup Filipino spiced vinegar, such as Datu Puti (see Recipe Notes)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 dried bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fried garlic</li>
      <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the following, adding each to the same small bowl as it is
        completed: Dice 1/4 large red onion (about 3/4 cup). Peel and mince 1/2
        head garlic (about 2 tablespoons). Add 1 1/2 teaspoons whole black
        peppercorns to the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thinly slice 1 medium scallion and reserve for garnish. Trim the stems
        from 2 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons canola or coconut oil in a Dutch oven or large
        heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Meanwhile,
        line a wire rack with a paper towel. Pat 3 pounds chicken drumsticks or
        thighs dry with paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in 2 batches, add the chicken to the pan and sear until browned
        on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Transfer to the paper towel.
        Use a fork to poke holes in the meaty parts and a paring knife to make
        slits in the skin of the seared chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion mixture to the pot (no need to drain the fat) and cook
        over medium heat until browned, about 3 minutes. Add 3/4 cup spiced
        vinegar and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a
        wooden spoon. Add 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed
        light brown sugar, and 4 dried bay leaves. Stir until the sugar is
        dissolved and bring to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the chicken skin-side up to the pot, arranging it in an even
        layer. Arrange the mushrooms on top, wedging them in between the
        chicken. Bring back to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and reduce the heat as needed to maintain a simmer. Cook until the
        meat is pulling away from the bones and the thickest part of the chicken
        registers at least 165ÂºF, rotating the chicken on top to the bottom of
        the pot halfway through if not in a single layer, about 30 minutes
        total.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and season the sauce with more vinegar, soy sauce, or brown sugar
        as needed - it should be vinegary, salty, and have a hint of sweetness.
        (Adobo tastes better made a day ahead and reheated.) Garnish with the
        scallions and 1 tablespoon fried garlic. Serve the chicken and sauce
        over rice, discarding the bay leaves as you come across them.
